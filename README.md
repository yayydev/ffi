# ffi

**ffi** is a high-performance, cross-platform file search utility written in C.  
It is designed to work efficiently on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, using multi-threading to maximize search speed.

## Features

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Multi-threaded search for maximum performance
- Recursive directory search
- Search by file name or path
- Requires administrator/root privileges for protected directories
- Written in C for speed and low-level access
- Easy to compile with `gcc`, `clang`, or `msvc`

## Usage

```

ffi -p /path/to/search -fn filename_pattern

```

### Arguments:

- `-p`, `--path` : Path to start the search (recursive search included)
